# Pizza_sales_SQL

This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset using MySQL to extract meaningful 
business insights. The dataset was imported into MySQL Workbench, and a series 
of basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries were executed to answer key business questions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL skills in data cleaning, aggregation, 
filtering, joins, window functions, and analytical queries, while also showcasing
how SQL can be used for real-world business decision-making.
